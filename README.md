# auth0-flask-utilities
Flask-based utilities for interfacing with the Auth0 Management API

## Ideas

- Build a flask-based webapp that allows me to add a user to an Auth0 hosted
  user data repository,
- Extend the app to search for and edit users stored in an Auth0 hosted user
  data repository.
